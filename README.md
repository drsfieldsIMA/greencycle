Going Green Starts Local

## Description

 Ever wondered how we can recycle more through our communities. We mean more of you and your networks phones, electrics, clothes and furniture recycled through this app. The GreenCycle community are here to safeguard and contribute to stewarding the Earths resources by leveraging the world wide webs scale.

## Built With

- [Next.js] (https://nextjs.org/)
- [SCSS] (https://sass-lang.com/)
- [Visual Studio Code] (https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Getting Started

### Installing and Running

To get started 

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com/drsfieldsIMA/greencycle.git
```

2. Open with a processor of your choice e.g. Visual Studio Code:

```
code .
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
